# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

The AI-Powered App Development Platform is built as a distributed microservices architecture that enables real-time conversational app development through AI-powered code generation.

## Core Components

### 1. Frontend Application (React + TypeScript)
- Chat interface for natural language interaction
- Code editor with syntax highlighting
- Live preview with hot reloading
- Project management and file explorer
- Voice interface integration

### 2. Backend API (Node.js + Express)
- RESTful API endpoints
- WebSocket connections for real-time communication
- Authentication and authorization
- Project and file management
- AI service integration

### 3. AI Engine (Python/Node.js)
- Natural language processing
- Code generation and optimization
- Intent classification
- Context management

### 4. Database Layer (PostgreSQL + Redis)
- User and project data persistence
- Session and cache management
- Conversation history storage

### 5. Code Execution Sandbox (Docker)
- Secure code execution environment
- Isolated container instances
- Resource limitations and monitoring

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui for styling
- Zustand for state management
- Socket.io for real-time communication

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Redis for caching
- Docker for containerization
- JWT for authentication

### Infrastructure
- Docker Compose for development
- Nginx for reverse proxy
- Prometheus for monitoring
- Grafana for metrics visualization

## Data Flow

1. User sends message through chat interface
2. Frontend sends request to backend via WebSocket
3. Backend processes request and calls AI engine
4. AI engine generates code based on conversation context
5. Generated code is validated and stored
6. Live preview updates in real-time
7. User can iterate with follow-up requests

## Security Measures

- JWT-based authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Sandboxed code execution
- Rate limiting
- HTTPS encryption
- Container security best practices

## Scalability Design

- Microservices architecture
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching layer
- CDN integration ready
- Load balancer support
