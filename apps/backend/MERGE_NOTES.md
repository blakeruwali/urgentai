# Backend Merge Resolution Notes

This document explains the merge resolution between the `cursor/setup-background-agent-with-openai-and-database` branch and the `main` branch.

## Conflicts Resolved

### package.json
- **Merged all dependencies** from both branches
- **Kept all scripts** from both branches (some are duplicates with different names)
- **Removed OpenAI**, replaced with Anthropic SDK
- **Added dependencies from main**: helmet, jsonwebtoken, socket.io, axios
- **Kept testing and database setup** from the background agent branch

### src/index.ts
- **Combined features from both branches**:
  - ✅ Anthropic integration (replaced OpenAI)
  - ✅ Socket.IO real-time support
  - ✅ Helmet security middleware
  - ✅ Winston logging
  - ✅ Comprehensive error handling
  - ✅ Database connection with health checks
  - ✅ Environment configuration with Zod
  - ✅ Chat endpoints with streaming support
  - ✅ Conversation management endpoints

## Key Features After Merge

### 1. **AI Integration**
- Anthropic Claude API instead of OpenAI
- Chat completions with streaming
- Support for Claude 3 models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- Token usage tracking

### 2. **Real-time Communication**
- Socket.IO for real-time updates
- Join/leave conversation rooms
- Real-time message broadcasting

### 3. **Database**
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Comprehensive schema for users, conversations, messages
- Usage tracking and API key management
- Database health monitoring

### 4. **Security & Configuration**
- Helmet for security headers
- CORS configuration
- JWT authentication ready (tokens configured)
- Environment validation with Zod

### 5. **Developer Experience**
- Winston logging with environment-based levels
- Comprehensive error handling
- TypeScript throughout
- Vitest for testing
- Database seeding

## Environment Variables Added

```env
# From main branch
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
JWT_EXPIRY=7d

# From background agent branch (with Anthropic instead of OpenAI)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=claude-3-opus-20240229
ANTHROPIC_MAX_TOKENS=1000
ANTHROPIC_TEMPERATURE=0.7
```

## Next Steps

1. **Authentication Implementation**: JWT middleware needs to be implemented using the jsonwebtoken package
2. **Database Integration**: Connect the mock endpoints to actual database operations
3. **Route Organization**: Create separate route files for better organization
4. **WebSocket Events**: Add more Socket.IO events for real-time features
5. **Testing**: Add tests for the new Socket.IO and chat endpoints

## Scripts Available

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start with hot reload
npm run build            # Build for production
npm start                # Run production build

# Database
npm run prisma:generate  # Generate Prisma client
npm run prisma:migrate   # Run migrations
npm run prisma:seed      # Seed database
# Alternative names from main:
npm run db:generate      # Same as prisma:generate
npm run db:migrate       # Same as prisma:migrate
npm run db:seed          # Same as prisma:seed

# Testing & Quality
npm test                 # Run tests
npm run test:watch       # Run tests in watch mode
npm run lint             # Run ESLint
npm run type-check       # TypeScript type checking
```

## Architecture Overview

```
Backend Server
├── Express + Socket.IO Server
├── Anthropic Claude Integration
├── PostgreSQL Database (via Prisma)
├── Real-time WebSocket Support
├── JWT Authentication (ready to implement)
├── Comprehensive Logging
└── Environment-based Configuration
```

The merge successfully combines the robust backend infrastructure from the background agent branch with the real-time features and additional security from the main branch.
